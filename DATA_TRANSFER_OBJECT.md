# Data Transfer Object (DTO)

A data transfer object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. It is a simple object that should not contain any business logic but may contain serialization and deserialization mechanisms for transferring data over the wire.

The motivation for using a DTO is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation. Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that would have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served by one call only.

DTOs are often used in conjunction with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. In MVC, the DTO is used to transfer data between the model and the view. The model is responsible for storing and manipulating data, while the view is responsible for displaying data to the user. The DTO is used to bridge the gap between the two.

DTOs can also be used in conjunction with the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) pattern. In SOA, services are used to provide access to data and functionality. DTOs can be used to transfer data between services.

## Benefits

- They can reduce the number of calls between processes. This can improve the performance of applications by reducing the amount of network traffic.
- They can make applications more modular and maintainable. DTOs can be used to encapsulate data and logic, which can make it easier to change and reuse code.
- They can make applications more scalable. DTOs can be used to transfer data between different components of an application, which can make it easier to scale applications as the amount of data or number of users increases.
- They can make applications more secure. DTOs can be used to transfer data between different parts of an application without exposing the underlying data structures and logic. This can make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in applications.
- They can make applications more readable. DTOs can be used to group data together in a way that makes it easier to read and understand. This can be helpful for developers, testers, and users.

## Drawbacks

- They can add complexity to applications. DTOs introduce an additional layer of abstraction, which can make applications more difficult to understand and maintain.
- They can make applications more difficult to test. DTOs are often used to transfer data between different components of an application. This can make it difficult to test individual components in isolation.
- They can make applications more difficult to debug. DTOs can hide the underlying data structures and logic of an application. This can make it difficult to track down the source of errors when they occur.
- They can lead to data duplication. If the same data is being transferred between different parts of an application, it can be duplicated in multiple DTOs. This can waste memory and make it difficult to keep the data consistent.
- They can make applications less scalable. DTOs can add overhead to applications. This can make it difficult to scale applications as the amount of data or number of users increases.

## Implementation

- **Using a custom class.** You can create a custom class to represent the data that needs to be transferred. This class should only contain data members and should not contain any business logic.
- **Using a built-in class.** Some programming languages provide built-in classes that can be used to represent data. For example, Java has the ### java.util.Map
  class, which can be used to represent a collection of key-value pairs.
- **Using a serialization framework.** A serialization framework can be used to convert objects to and from a serial representation. This can be useful if you need to transfer data between different programming languages or platforms.

```ts
interface CreateOrderPayload {
  // ...
}
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Not using DTOs at all.** DTOs can be a useful tool for transferring data between processes, but they are often overlooked. If you are transferring data between different parts of your application, you should consider using DTOs to make the process more efficient and maintainable.
- **Using DTOs for business logic.** DTOs should only be used to transfer data. They should not contain any business logic. If you need to store or manipulate data, you should use a different type of object, such as a domain model or a service object.
- **Not using DTOs consistently.** If you are using DTOs in some parts of your application, you should use them in all parts of your application. This will make your code more consistent and easier to maintain.
- **Not designing DTOs carefully.** DTOs should be designed carefully to meet the specific needs of your application. You should consider the following factors when designing DTOs:
  - The data that needs to be transferred
  * The format of the data
  * The way the data will be used
  * The performance requirements of your application
- **Not testing DTOs.** DTOs should be tested just like any other type of object. You should test the DTOs to make sure they are working correctly and that they are meeting the needs of your application.
