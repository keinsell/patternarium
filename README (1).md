Welcome to Patternarium - the playground of design patterns!

This repository is the result of my personal notebook, where I jot down all my discoveries and insights about design patterns. And since sharing is caring, I've decided to share my notes with you all!

Now, I know what you're thinking - this repository might be messy and disorganized. But hey, it's a work in progress and I'm always looking for ways to improve it. Who knows, maybe I'll find a way to automate it in the future, so stay tuned!

But in the meantime, feel free to browse through my notes and discover new and exciting design patterns. And don't worry about the quality of the code - as long as it's abstracted, modular, and testable, it's good enough for me!
