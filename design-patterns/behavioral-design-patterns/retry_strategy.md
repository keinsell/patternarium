# Retry Strategy

Retry Strategy is a design pattern that addresses the issue of transient failures in distributed systems. It involves retrying failed operations automatically with a certain delay and a maximum number of attempts, in order to increase the likelihood of success.

A Retry Strategy typically includes several parameters and strategies for determining when and how to retry failed operations. Some of these parameters might include the maximum number of retries, the delay between retries, and the backoff factor for increasing the delay on subsequent retries. The strategies might include using an exponential backoff strategy or a linear backoff strategy to increase the delay, and determining whether an error is transient or permanent based on its type or other characteristics.

By using a Retry Strategy, applications can handle transient failures more gracefully, without requiring manual intervention or causing unnecessary disruption to users or other systems. This can improve the overall reliability and availability of the application, and help to avoid cascading failures or other unintended consequences of failed operations.

```ts
/** Retry Strategy is a design pattern that addresses the issue of transient failures in distributed systems. It involves retrying failed operations automatically with a certain delay and a maximum number of attempts, in order to increase the likelihood of success. */
interface RetryStrategy {
  /** The maximum number of times that a failed operation should be retried. */
  maxRetries: number;
  /** The initial delay (in milliseconds) between retries. */
  retryDelay: number;
  /** The factor by which the retry delay should be multiplied on each retry. For example, if the initial retry delay is 100ms and the backoff factor is 2, the delay will be 200ms on the second retry, 400ms on the third retry, and so on. */
  backoffFactor: number;

  /** A method that determines whether a failed operation can be retried based on the error that was thrown. This method should return true if the error is transient and retrying the operation is likely to succeed, and false if the error is permanent and retrying the operation is unlikely to succeed. */
  canRetry(error: Error): boolean;
  /** A method that calculates the delay (in milliseconds) before the next retry based on the current retry count. This method should use the retry delay and backoff factor properties to calculate the delay, and can be customized to implement different backoff strategies (such as exponential or linear backoff). */
  getNextDelay(retryCount: number): number;
}
```

```ts
class ExponentialRetryStrategy implements RetryStrategy {
  maxRetries: number;
  retryDelay: number;
  backoffFactor: number;

  constructor(maxRetries: number, retryDelay: number, backoffFactor: number) {
    this.maxRetries = maxRetries;
    this.retryDelay = retryDelay;
    this.backoffFactor = backoffFactor;
  }

  canRetry(error: Error): boolean {
    // Return true if the error is transient and can be retried
    return error instanceof TransientError;
  }

  getNextDelay(retryCount: number): number {
    // Calculate the delay using an exponential backoff strategy
    return this.retryDelay * Math.pow(this.backoffFactor, retryCount);
  }
}

class MyService {
  retryStrategy: RetryStrategy;

  constructor() {
    this.retryStrategy = new ExponentialRetryStrategy(5, 1000, 2);
  }

  async doSomething(): Promise<void> {
    let retryCount = 0;

    while (retryCount <= this.retryStrategy.maxRetries) {
      try {
        // Do something that may fail
        await someAsyncOperation();
        return;
      } catch (error) {
        if (this.retryStrategy.canRetry(error)) {
          // Calculate the delay before the next retry
          const delay = this.retryStrategy.getNextDelay(retryCount);

          // Wait for the specified delay before retrying
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));

          retryCount++;
        } else {
          // Rethrow the error if it's not transient
          throw error;
        }
      }
    }

    // Throw an error if the operation failed after all retries
    throw new Error(`Failed after ${this.retryStrategy.maxRetries} retries.`);
  }
}
```
