# Queue-Based Load Leveling

Queue-Based Load Leveling is an alternative name for the Inbox Pattern, a design pattern used in message-driven systems. It refers to the use of a queue to store incoming messages, and to have worker processes that take messages from the queue and process them. The name “Queue-Based Load Leveling” reflects the fact that this pattern helps to balance the load in a system by decoupling the sender and receiver components and allowing the receiver to control the pace of processing.

In this pattern, incoming messages are placed in a queue, and worker processes take messages from the queue and process them as they become available. This allows the system to handle bursts of incoming messages and maintain a steady flow of processing, without overloading any individual component.

The Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern can be used to build scalable, resilient, and decoupled systems, and is often used in applications such as message brokering, task management, and event-driven architectures.
